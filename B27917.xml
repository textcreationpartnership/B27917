            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Ʋpon a Seige in Generall.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Seige, is when an Enemy sits down before a Town, or Garrison, the Assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants resolved to carry it, and the Defendants to keepe to the utmost of their power. Amongst the many waies of enmity, whereby in a declared Warre men use to expresse their endeavours to ruine one another; This of a Seige is the sharpest and the saddest, if we consider the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of assayling and defending.</p>
            <p>The difficulty of assayling a well fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Garrison is such, that in reason a man may well wonder at every passage in it: that the Commander should value his men so cheape as to put them on upon so desperate an attempt; that he should force them forward when they are averse,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:207825:7"/> and drive them into the mouth of danger, wherein he doth foresee that they must perish, and knowes that though he have their hands he hath not their hearts in that enterprise; that the Souldier can be either perswaded or constrained to enter the jawes of Death, and undertake the work, wherein he knowes there is scarce one of a hundred that doth not miscarry: that so poore a hope as of the pillage should be a motive sufficient to draw him on: that the carrying of it at the last, should be a sufficient compensation for so many lives as are usually last in the attempt. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of defending is full of wonder too, wherein to try the courage and patience of the Defendants are presented to their view, the power of a whole Army, furnished with the instruments of Death, and all kind of Weapons and Engines to offend or fright them, set down before the Garrison, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their own strength to take it, and commonly well informed of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants strength to hold it, and upon those grounds resolved to goe through with it. Nor can they possibly be ignorant with how much shame &amp; dishonour the Enemy
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:207825:7"/> shall recede if he miscarry? with how much obstinacy he will contend to perfect it? with how much rage and fury he will conclude if he prevaile in it? After these, there offer themselves likewise unto his thoughts the vast labour he must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe to keep it: the danger more then the toyle: the want of sleep and rest, the scarcity of all things necessary to support nature, and to maintaine life: Against all which he hath nothing to put into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, but his Conscience to God, his Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to his Prince and Country, and his Honor in the Enemies repulse. And truely he that hath these hath enough. What good man, for his Conscience, would not sacrifice his life, much more endanger it? What Subject, to save his Loyalty, would not venture all that worldlings count deare or pretious? especially, where the goodnesse of his Soveraigne makes his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty double, and strengthens the obligation? What Gentleman or Souldier cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise his safety, whilest he regards his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? They owe their byrth and breeding to the Pesantrie, that have no sense of it: He that hath the bloud of a true Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:207825:8"/> flowing in his veines, cannot devest it though he would; and though some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate discontent may lay it a while asleep, yet in the pinch of tryall it will rouse him up, to doe things brave and noble, and worthy of himselfe, in spight of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary intention or resolution. If this faile in any few particulars, they are Mushromes of a late &amp; sodaine growth, that beside the Title and Habit, weare nothing of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or of a Souldier: And surely accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the old Maxime, That the passive part of Fortitude is the noblest; he that rides out a Seige, and gives his Enemy the check, beares away the greatest honour: though, if the active part of Fortitude in services were to be disputed, he hath a faire Title too. Such honour they shall never want, that with the integrity of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable resolution, have devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to serve their God, their King, their Country and their Fame.</p>

               <p>Of streightning and sterving the Besieged.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter a generall view, particulars claime their turnes; amongst which Hunger deserves to lead in Front, as being the cruellest engine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to subdue the strongest resolutions. In this particular the disadvantage of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiger, and the advantage of the Beseiged, is the intervening of time: Which, where the dangers threaten death, is to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no small benefit, for thereby wisdome hath oportunity to mature her designes, and to lay all things handsomly for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting her worke: thereby patience growes better arm'd to beare the event, because she hath the lesse reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that expectation was deceived. The greatest spirits and resolutions are subject to be surprised, nor is every man so much master of himselfe as to call all his strengths about him on a sodain: but when we have seene the clouds a long time in gathering, and the storme grow upon us by sensible
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:207825:9"/> and slow degrees, he that doth not fit and prepare for the worst, hath more of heart then of braine, and of courage then discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is therfore God's great mercy to us, that in so sharp a tryall as this of famin, men should have the full advantage of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, that so they may resolve what best becomes a Christian and a loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But this storme which comes on so slowly, falls heavily at last; a speedy death by the Sword, or by a bullet, being but a trifle in comparison of those insufferable torments which they endure that are pinch't with famine. Examples are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous of those that have eaten their own children, nay their own flesh from their armes; and those that had food in private, have not found oportunity to eate in safety, but have had it snatch't out of their hands, nay even out of their mouthes by those that have broke in upon them, and they have paid their lives into the bargaine, the price of the concealement. This misery of a Seige, pinches none more bitterly, then great and populous Cities. whose nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inhabitants make all provisions quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scarce, so soone as they are cut off from

And God in justice many times suffers this calamity to fall upon them, that their punishment may be the better suited to their sinnes: The noted sinne of such Cities as boast themselves the Queens and Ladies of their Provinces, is Luxurie and excesse of meates and drinkes, which they lavish out even with pride and vanitie, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in the cost and change of studied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, rak't from all quarters, as much for ostentation as for use; with these, the pamper'd body swels and growes fat, and is stall-fed for wantonnesse and lust; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (too too often) the prime intention of such excesse to spur dull nature up, and by prepared incentives to kindle that hellish fire, which Religion teaches us rather to quench by studied temperance and acts of mortification. Now then thou wretched Epicure, whose belly hath been thy god, and luxury thy happinesse, in which thou hast weltred with securitie, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all pious admonitions so many yeares; when God hath brought thee to these streights, think how much bitterer thy cup will be then other mens, whose hearts shall not check them with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:207825:10"/> of thy madd excesse, or thy unsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated lust. It is gall and wormwood, in the want of foode, to remember how much we have vainly lavish't both with sinne and shame. It is as daggers stab'd into the heart, when the enfeebled body faints and pines, and consumes and languishes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of reliefe, to thinke how high 'twas kept before, chiefly for this cause; that it might not faile to serve us in our lewd delights. Then you despised the poore, and would not relieve them though you might: now they'l despise you, and force reliefe from you whether you will or not; nay even that little which is all that you have left for to relieve your selves. Then varietie of dainties found no relish with you: now you would think your selves feasted with the driest crust. Then perhaps drunkennesse was your habituall sinne, now you would give all you have but for any thing that were wholsome to quench your thirst. O! how heavy is the scourge, when God thus findes us out in our beloved sinnes. To sinne by intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is bad at all times; but in the times of warre, when this danger overtakes many,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:207825:10"/> and threatens all, if we think our selves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to no moderation, to no abatement of our former height, vengeance will reach us at the last, and we shall fall a spectacle to others, of those whom God doth punish in the same kind they sinne.</p>

Besides this generall tye, there is a particular bond of duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those, whom either nature or divine institution have joyn'd in extraordinary neerenesse: and it is generally presum'd of them, that they will willingly assist those to whom they are so related in their

Military discipline, that should be rigid in all things, should be most severe in this, as drawing with it such an error as can never be repaired.

If I die by a Canon shot, or a Granadoe, I die sodainly, and my paine is quickly at an end; and yet I count it not a sodaine death in regard of my Soule, because I saw the occasion of my triall coming, and had time enough to prepare my selfe before it came, by making my peace with God, and with the world: That granted, how much more wretchedly might I have died in my bed, perhaps languishing of a tedious sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, till I grew a burthen both to my selfe, and all my friends; perhaps rackt and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with cruell fits of the stone, or of the cholick, or of some ulcer in the tender parts, before which I would preferre death a thousand times, and yet should often wish it when I could not have it; perhaps rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and decaying part by part, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable stench, which neither I my selfe, nor any of my freinds, nor those whom hire makes stoope to any offices, are able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; perhaps smitten by the hand of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a contagious infection, which leaves me desolate in death, with none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, but those whose sordid avarice
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:207825:21"/> strikeing at petty gaine, shall make them more readie to set me packing for their owne advantage, then to attend me with care and faithfullnesse in that distresse. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, he that dies in his bed acquires no honour: he that dies in service doth; if Conscience and Loyaltie engag'd him to it. Lord, grant me but thy grace to live, whilst I live, so as I should; and I will not wish to know when or how I shall die; but shall resolve to think that best which thou shalt send, and to welcome it with that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse and resolution which doth become a man, and much more a Christian.</p>

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:207825:21"/> upon them, which (if done in time) doth stifle the fire, and so put it out. Where those helps are not in readinesse, they many times doe much mischiefe in a little time. For nothing is more violent then fire, when it hath got the masterie, both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying all before it, and endangering them likewise very much that come to quench it. How many endeavouring to save that out of the ravenous flames which was deare unto them, have lost themselves? How many have so escaped, that it had been little worse, nay perhaps better for them to have perished? Where the effects of it are most milde, they are sad enough, and extreme full of terror, both to the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, and to the spectators too. Nothing is more in a wise man's care then to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this danger, or to suppresse it, if it be possible, ere it break out too farre. The ordinarie casualties of peace instruct us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how horrid the effects are which follow such disasters: But warre adds so much to the horror of them, that here the enemie endeavours to fire severall places at once, to the end that men distracted in their cares and feares, may not know which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:207825:22"/> way to turne: And here the usuall helps are more to seeke, whether of men, or meanes to put it out; the one having work enough in tending their defence, the other being either not provided, or rather not to be got in every place. Hence it comes many times to passe, that all is left a Sacrifice to the mercilesse flames, and they rage without restraint, till they have turned all into ashes and desolation. A rue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spectacle for a long time after, to every eye that sees it, and on which a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fixe his thoughts, but his heart shall earne, to think how much they suffer'd that were concern'd. From thence how easilie may we transferre our thoughts to that sad day, when the whole world shall burne in flames, and the elements shall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heate, and therein not only we, and all that we can call ours shall be lost together, but besides, those flames shall be the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of our greatest tryall, wherein we must give our accompt to an impartiall judge of all our enmities and contestations, of the justnesse of the warres that we have undertaken, of the advised and deliberate injuries and mischiefes that we have done,

Who can dwell with this everlasting fire? Or who can abide these continuall burnings? And yet abide we must, for escape we cannot, unlesse the Conscience of a well-led life stand up in judgement to pleade for us.

What should we say but that we live in an age fertile in teeming mischeife, and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant in inventing varied wayes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? It were not hyperbolicall to averre that their hearts are as hard, as are the stones they shoote, and as uncapeable of melting or of inteneration. For though the law of armes make it faire to doe any thing in the way of open force that may annoy the enemie, yet no law ever did allow men to engage themselves in a desperate contest, and in declar'd hostilitie, without first weighing unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the justinesse of the cause, and the faire grounds they goe upon to be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. The neglect of that makes it a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him that kills his foe, which he can never answer either to God or man. And in this case, the more active a man is the worse, and the more eager the more wretched, for so his guilt swells higher, and he hath the more to answere for what he doth. Varied inventions to annoy the foe, are but varied sinnes; and he never hurts his enemie, but he more

But be the danger never so great, there want not them which will venture, and come on to fasten it, though they be never so likely to perish in the attempt. In the condition of martiall service it is alwayes so, that all important actions are full of danger. The way to victorie is stor'd with precipices, and death in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindes lurking in every corner, nay sometimes with open face presented in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:207825:26"/> the most hideous formes, stands away<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them that venture. Honor is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome bought at a cheape price: yet it is not accompted deare where a man doth not part with his conscience to purchase it. He that will list himselfe for the feild, must expect the hazard, and resolve to runne it: for being once enroll'd he can neither goe on with safety, nor goe back with honor. And sure he that cannot despise danger, was never layd out for a souldier. Be the danger what it will, the commands of a Generall are to be executed not disputed, and a chearfull and exact obedience best becomes a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall spirit. They should not know feare that wage warre: at least they should be able to cast it out, where judgement tells them that it misbecomes them, and is a hindrance to the perfecting of that worke wherein they are engaged. One timorous man, nay one timorous carriage of one man in an army, many times over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the whole enterprise, and drawes many thousands with him into one common ruine. Sure he that well considers it, hath not much to feare,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:207825:27"/> where he is sure either to dye a Martyr, or come off a conquerour; where he shall not want honor whilst he lives, nor peace of conscience when he dies. Many a man lives too long, that lives with shame: but no man dies too soone, that dies with honor. What is it that I was borne into the world, and that I live for, but to serve my God, my King, and Country with my life, and with my fortunes? And this if I have done, although I die at twenty, I have lived more then he that hath spunne out a hundred uselesse yeares. They are not properly said to live, that live but to themselves, haveing atcheiv'd nothing of goodnesse, or of glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other men To have fill'd up the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or made one in the number of an armie for many yeares together, and in all that time to have no name, or note, is worse then to have been a droane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Bees; because sense only is their guide, but reason should be ours. The weaknesse of one timorous man doth much mischiefe, but his example doth a great deale more. And there is nothing wherein it concerns a Generall to be more
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:207825:27"/> vigilant, then to find such cowards out, and to casheire them. A few resolved men, whom danger cannot daunt, shall doe wonders; and a man shall scarce at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing, which he shall not find feisible with such assistance. Bequeath feares to women, old men, and children, in whom they are pardonable: in a man they are not: and in a souldier least. Yet I would not have rashnesse mistaken in stead of valour, nor foole-hardinesse in stead of courage. Fortitude is not blinde, nor a just resolution void of judgement. What he attempts, and why, how he may likeliest carry it, and when the nick of time is to put on, he hath it all preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated that is truly valiant. The danger of the enterprise comes in but upon the by, and troubles not his thoughts, he reckons it a thing of course, which if it should stop his speed he would reckon that he did stumble at a straw. If any such poore thought steale in upon him at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, it is but an inmate, that unregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded may sojourn for a while, but must not dwell nor tarry in a noble bosome.

A sleight recompence will not countervaile such an undertaking: Nor is it a businesse for one man alone to goe

Nor are men of ordinarie parts fit to be embarqu'd as the cheife agents in such an affaire.

If fordid avarice did not blinde them, they must needs see, that those which have once falsified their saith, must ne're be trusted more; and they that would be once corrupted, must ne're be used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

In the preservation of these how many times is providence deceiv'd? how many tymes is all the care, and paines and cost bestow'd to save, and to secure them utterly cast away? and in the twincling of an eye those stores blowne up, which were a long time in

That providence can never be deceiv'd, ours may, and is. And if we have but patience to waite the event, we shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discerne how it formes all things for
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:207825:32"/> the best, even those which seem'd most casuall in their nature, and most bitter for the present. It is true, that commonly our affection to these things is more, or lesse, as was the time, and care, and cost, and paines which were imploy'd about them: for those things we love better, and part with more unwillingly, which are set off to our acceptation by such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deerements. Yet when we are conscious to our selves of no neglect in that fitting, though not anxious care, which we did use to keepe them, if an unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which we could neither probably have foreseene, nor easily have prevented force them out of our hands, we are to reckon that God requires them backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, against whose pleasure to repine cannot become our duty. Thou ô God that hast given all, take what thou wilt, take it how, and when thou pleasest, take it in an instant, take it when I least suspect it, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take not my patience from me, nor my obedient submission unto thy blessed will, take not my faith from me, whereby I am throughly perswaded that all my suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings shall turne to my advantage, nor take

Yet of the two, (both naturalists, and experience it selfe attesting the same) it is confest, that thirst is the sharper, and the more incomportable. Besides that the annoyance of unholsome beveridg is more destructive, then of unwholsome foode, and the sad effects of it more suddaine, and more pernicious. For many things may be found for food, when customary provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons faile, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> though they be not so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with our constitution, yet they are not contrary in an extream degree, but so as even unto them the stomack may enure it selfe by degrees, and be able in some measure to beare the change: but if it come once to that passe that water cannot be had, all other liquors (of which
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:207825:34"/> such a proportion may be hoped, as to sustaine life) must needs be such, as a small tryall shall evince to be destructive unto nature. Not to speake of the want of it to dresse any kinde of foode, nor of the noysome stench, and inevitable nasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which follows upon the want of it for other uses. If therefore the spring or rivers that water a garrison can be dreyned, or cut off, there will need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sword to cut the gordian knot of that contest. Surely it is not easie to conceive but by tryall (which God graunt we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may) how intolerable the torments are which they endure, whose bowels are shrunke with thirst, their flesh dried up, and withered, their inwards flameing with intensive heate, their hearts, and spirits fainting, their tongues cleaving to their drie pallats, the light of their eyes dimm'd, and the whole man flave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent and decay'd, and wearied with the drought which he can beare no longer. Civility scarce beares the mention of those things, which in such extreames are eagerly hunted after, and greedily drunke off to quench thirst. Nor is it onely in a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:207825:35"/> siege that men are so opprest, in hot servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and cruell battailes, disputed long and eagerly on both sides; in long and speedy marches; in necessitated journeyes by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and untroden pathes for feare of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies men meet the same affliction. And when I remember how frequent all these are amongst us in these times, and how many men have been brought, by these severall meanes, to the very gates of death, if not utterly destroyed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame thirst, it makes me apt to thinke that God intends to upbraide us with that infamous, and sinfull height of drinkeing which hath been so universally receiv'd, and practised among all sorts of people. It is but just that they should want water, that would endure no stint in wine; that they that wanton'd in varietie of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors should want any that is wholsome: that they which drunke continually when they had no thirst, should thirst when they have no drinke: that they which inflam'd themselves willingly by excesse, should be enflam'd by drought against their wills, for want of a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to refresh their entrailes. Those that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:207825:35"/> are now most deafe to these instructions, will resent them most deeply then; and their own guilt awakened by their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will double their sorrowes on them, and make that crosse more heavie unto them then others. Besides that the habit of drinking makes an unnaturall thirst, and calls more eagerly for those supplies, which being not to be had, make the want more afflictive. A temperate man beares thirst a great deale better; and is also free from those secret stings of guilt, and bath a stronger hope, and better grounded, that God will one way, or other send him release. If it come not, yet his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt is cast, and he submits unto the will of God: by whose speciall favor (no man ever did deny it) in one and the same condition of want either of meats, or drinkes, all men doe not feele the same degree of torment, nor have not the same sharpnesse of hunger, or of thirst upon them. God makes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence where he pleases: never without just cause, alwayes well known to him, though sometimes unknown to us.</p>

The endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the beseiged is to find out the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice (for which they have certaine proofes) to marke which way they worke, and counter-mine them. What in open view cannot be attempted, seems to be undertaken with more safety under ground. Yet no sooner is a new way found out to annoy, then new waies are found out on the other side to prevent that annoyance: God having made man as ingenious to invent things for his owne defence, as to doe mischiefe. And it is well provided for humane safetie, that where malice hath a sword, innocence should have a buckler; and where the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saylant
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:207825:36"/> may infest, the defendant may not want a cure. Wherein it is just with God that the mischeife of the first mover should fall sometimes upon his own head, and he be caught in his own craft, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his own snare; that a Myne should by a counter-Myne be brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and not only their labour lost that wrought in it, but many times their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons too. Such are the hazards of these attempts, which yet cannot deterre the undertakers from adventuring. But it is no news to see desperate gamesters wage great stakes, and ventrous Merchants en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themselves farre, when they are come to such a state that a small adventure cannot keepe them up. It is the highest part of wisedome to weigh things well at first, whilest yet a man is free, and hath as full power of himselfe, as he can wish; many a man hath wisht that he could have gone back, when it hath been too late; and hath repented in vaine his rash en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageing of himselfe to those dangers, which perhaps he had never known if he had not tried. In the bowels of the earth he that digges out new waies, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:207825:37"/> through that covert darknesse makes his passage, must not wonder to meete with accidents to which he is a stranger, and those such as doe bring dangers with them, for which he could provide no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, because he did not expect them. In those cavernes, what more usuall then suddain eruptions of waters, somtimes in great aboundance; then strange and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant sulphureous vapors, which suffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the spirits, and prove suddainlie mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to those that meete them in so pent a passage?

Yet few can be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they dig their owne graves, but (carried on with rage and with desire) promise themselves a safe returne from thence, where death in more then one shape doth attend them.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE entering of a breach, is of all the services in warre the most desperate: for it is the entering upon the mouth of the Canon, upon the muzle of the musket, upon the point of the pike, besides traynes of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be expected from beneath, and showres of stones, and bullets from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, with the mortall stroake of the bill or halbert when they come within the reach, and the carbyne and pistol, and pole-axe standing at the receipt, if they breake through the rest: insomuch that it seemes almost a miracle any man should escape that comes on with the first, till multitude (oppressing, and tireing the defendants) have made the passage both more safe and easie. Yet after all this losse many times the attempt miscarries, when the defendant perceiving where the breach was likely to be made, hath raised
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:207825:38"/> new works within, and so beates the assaylant off with no small detriment. How hard and desperate are the services which avarice, and ambition, and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, we may say (but too often) which the world and the devill puts us on upon! and yet how chearefully, how resolvedly doe we undergoe them! How faire, and easie, how safe and secure those that God puts us on upon, and yet how hardly are we drawen on, and how soone doe we recoyle! How few are they that venture their estates, their lives, or limbes to save their Consciences? or that are willing to endanger themselves to serve their God? A better Master I am sure we cannot serve; whose commands are more just, whose ends are more noble, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are more certaine, whose accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our endeavours is more gratious, whose love to us is more unchangeable, whose care of us is greater, whose prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is more safe, or whose service is more honourable. Yet not only danger, but the very shadow of danger staggers us in our obedience towards him. Full we are of delaies and of excuses; cold and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:207825:39"/> timorous and doubtfull, and full of scruples: One while a beame, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while a mote is in our eyes, and they cannot be cast out: one while we stumble at a block, another while at a straw, and cannot be got forwards: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much spurring on, if we begin, we straight grow faint and wearie: every discouragement puts us off againe, and makes us looke back after we have put our hands unto the Plough, It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to inferre that our affection unto God and goodnesse, is lesse then to these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, when we may have them, and yet will not buy them at a farre easier rate. If my tie to God were not greater, my sinne were lesse; now my fault is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that where I owe more, I pay lesse; and where I owe lesse, I pay more. Yet I would not be understood, as if I went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to discourage a Souldier in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his commander set over him by his Prince, so long as he continues loyall to him that placed him; the Souldiers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience (be the danger what it will) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too chearefull, too punctuall, or too resolved. Yet God must not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:207825:39"/> to whom our obedience is due in the first place. I am sure he cannot erre in his cōmands, but all men may: What he requires is ever just and lawfull; they may (and doe require somtimes) that which is otherwise. Shall every man be judge then of his Superiors commands, and take upon him to dispute them, or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his obedience till he be satisfied? farre be that from my thoughts; neither the rules of policie, nor of divinitie allow it. In things not simply, indisputably, and manifestly evill, they must be obeyed, and that without disputing: wherein if they should erre that doe obey, being put on that which were not lawfull, God would require it at their Superiours hands, which did not weigh with judgement what they did command; but not at theirs, whose dutie was obedience. Our obedience to God can admit no exception, and yet we halt in that a great deale more: But a weake eye may discern the fountaine of this difference. A corporall, a visible, a sensible, a present punishment which may be inflicted doth over-awe us, when we neglect the execution of their commands
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:207825:40"/> whom a Prince hath set over us: And the discipline of warre requires that it be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously inflicted, lest that disobedience be drawne into example; but the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our disobedience to God being invisible, and the time uncertaine when it shall be inflicted, encourages fond men to be over-indulgent to themselves, when they see they cannot serve God but with losse and danger.

In the trenches the beseiged can annoy him lesse: from the batteries he can annoy them more: and both parts are equally in his thoughts, as well to preserve his owne men, as to destroy the enemy. Indeed the great masters of warre have determined that it more concernes a Generall to save one of his owne men, then to destroy ten of the enemies: And if they be veterane bands, and tried souldiers, the reasons are apparent: their approv'd fidelitie, and affection to their leader, their courage and valour discover'd by many trialls, their judgm̄ent to know in service what should be done, and their readinesse to doe, springing from use and exercise,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:207825:42"/> sets the price upon them. If they perish and miscarrie, though those that shall be listed in their roomes may have as much spirit and courage, as much faith and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, yet their Leader cannot have so much confidence of them till he have tried them: besides that their knowledg, and activitie for service must be a worke of time. Adde to these that nothing can be more pernicious to a Commander, then to have it reported, and beleived of him that he values his Souldiers cheape, and cares not how many of them he casts rashly away in any desperate imployment.

And in the long processe of a warre, he that in every new action or expedition is put to use new men, because his old are lost, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie, if he succeed in one action shall miscarie in many; and if he perfect his worke at last to his desire, he shall owe it more to fortune, then to prudence, as having gone against the Principles of warre, and reason.

What could not be done at the first sallie, may be done at a second, or at a third; nor should he that leads the partie consider how much he doth at once, but how well. He shall breake the enemie at times, as surely, and more safely; and it is folly to catch at that harvest, which he may reape by leisure. Patiently to a waite the ripening of our hopes, is the great rule of humane undertakings: and he that so conquers
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:207825:55"/> the enemie hath a double honor of it. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath first conquer'd himselfe, and made his desires stoope unto his reason, and his affections to his judgment. Better to goe out, and doe nothing of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ten times, then to miscarrie once. Yet if discretion steere the course, and the cause be just, God usually gives the blessing, and a man may with reason hope both to doe good service in a sallie, and to come off unhurt.</p>

For though it be a rule very necessarie by the Governor of a garrison to be observ'd, to keepe himselfe free from incombrances, and not clogge, or pester his garrison with women, and children, who in such a place doe (for the most part) but help to destroy provisions, and to spend the store, and to dishearten and discourage the souldier in the time of danger by their feares, and passions, which they are not able to master, or overcome; yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoyded but they must be allowed for necessarie uses, for suttlers, for laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, to tend the sick, and the like.

But a pious, and a prudent man laies it down for his rule, let safety be the end, and let what will be the meanes: let successe crowne the action, and he will never blush to be interrogated who were the instruments. It is God's mercy to me that he sends me any help in my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse: it becomes me not to dispute it with him, why it was no better.

It is therefore usually aim'd either at a body of the enemie coming on, so soone as they are within reach, or in a storme at those that climbe up the workes, to take many of them off together. Against this kind of shot that scatters so, there is the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, all parts of the bodie from head to foot being equally exposed to it: and if the markes-man be master of his art, he seldome failes to doe much mischeife: so much as makes it a sad spectacle to see, but much sadder to be endur'd. It is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie to think how little they regard it, or how vnpre pared they are commonly for death, which know it doth awaite them in so many kinds. If a man consider advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly the customary manner of a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers life, how boldly he lets loose the raines to all licenciousnesse, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely he spends his time, how his common talke is full of fearefull oathes, and imprecations, how his thoughts are wholly taken up either with vanitie, or sinne, and rarelie any thing of God, or goodnesse in them, how habituall drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse is with him, and how often he

If a man died like a beast, and were sure that all his miserie should determine in the grave, yet one would thinke mortalitie it selfe were curb enough to restraine him from such madnesie. But having been instructed as a Christian how much more miserie attends them in another life whose actions are so disorder'd, it is almost past beleife, that men should be so stupid in the midst of danger, and so regardlesse of their change. Virtues are all of kinne, and neerly related to one another. True fortitude is not divided from temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor temperance from prudence, nor prudence from justice; and he hath none of them in perfection, that hath not all of them in some reasonable measure. A man may see them all sometimes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:207825:60"/> (though but rarelie) in a souldier in such an eniment degree, that they make him accomplisht in all points, and shine with such a lustre, that they bewitch men with the love of him in whom they are, and force a veneration. And that vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is paid universally, not only to their persons whilst they live, but to their memorie likewise when they are dead: whereas the other (names of no price) live without love, and die without being desired; they are counted brutish both in life, and death, and fall, as they stood, without regard. When they have paid their due to nature, a ditch, or a pit, or the open feild in which they are left neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and forgetfullnesse with the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are their hire; unlesse infamy revive their faults, not permitting them to sleep quiet in the dust. It is but an error to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, that he must needes feare death that thinks of it often, or that the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of mortalitie (so often presented to the eye in time of warre) should blunt the edge of Valour.

Yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of the event make it a sad dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster: they are not many that shall come to know the truth of their condition, and with them that know it not, they shall suffer in point of reputation for the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render: they are not allwayes sure to finde equall hearing, or to be beleiv'd when they report the truth, neither from them that must be their Judges, nor from others that will be their censurers, who sometimes out of hatred, sometimes out of envie report things worse then they

Surely the hazard of misconstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in these things is unavoydible, and he shall very hardly save his fame in these things, that saves his conscience. Yet Garrisons have been held with spirit and resolution so long, till all the world hath been amply satisfied of the surrender, and willingly acknowledge as much done, and suffer'd for the holding of it, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane possibilitie could reach.

The truth is a surrender is a nice point, and the greatnesse of the losse filling mens mindes with indignation, makes it more lyable to suspicion, and however men may flatter themselves, they will finde it no easie matter to give satisfaction in it. Men are not apt to favour one another in their censures, especially where they can finde any colour to traduce, and that they never faile of in this case. He knowes

Great and good things are purchased many times at so deare a rate that they undoe the buyer; yet when they be in the way to greater, and that these without them cannot be obtained, a man must be content to buy them as they may be had. Yet these kinde of purchases are commonly the unluckiest, where both the buyer and the seller repent the bargaine, and both go off loosers at the parting.

This is the sadde minute in which exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution plies her taske, and death hastens to dispatch away all that she meetes, so that often times a few minutes sees a whole Garrison alive, and dead.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:207825:78"/> necessary, or what was convenient in the ranke wherein God had placed us, we made our habits the ensignes of our pride, and gloried to out-vie others (though never so expensive) in costly braverie; when invention was almost at a stand, and that which was rich and costly did not please, unlesse it were new too, and unusuall; when our attire was a great part of our studie, and to come forth bright, and glorious as the sunne, our cheifest ayme. If such follies should not have a check, and such pride should not meete a fall, many a one would perish, whom affliction now brings home unto repentance. Lord, thou knowest that we have all enough to answere (even those that have least) for the errors of our youth, sinnes that plentie and aboundance did occasion in us, bring us home, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, to repentance, whether with, or against our wills, and then by whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meanes it is, and how harsh soever or unpleasant to the sense, it is no matter: it is an easie purchase, by a litle corporall affliction, to againe our peace with thee.</p>

It is some advantage toward the bearing of them, that some of them are to be expected from the enemie of course, and though they come unwelcome, they come not unlookt for. Such a one is this that we are now to speake of, of the disaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in diet, and lodging. Where there are many to be provided for, it cannot easily be avoided, although the conqueror were willing to doe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; it sitts most heavie, where it may be helpt, and is not, either through the neglect, and barbarous incivilitie of those to whom the care of it belongs; or (which is worse) out of spight, and malice,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:207825:79"/> and an ignoble, and base delight to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over men, and insult upon them in their affliction. A wicked and hellish disposition, and becoming neither Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, nor men. It were lesse crueltie to put the vanquished to the sword, and so put a period both to their sufferings and their lives at once, then to wire▪draw their torments, and spinne out their miserie by long continuance, when perhaps their death by those meanes is both desired, and intended. It goes high when a man shall scarce find those conveniences amongst them, that they would afford a dogge; and his dyet and lodging are purposely so order'd, as not only shall not stand with conveniencie, but not with health nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no nor so much as with life, if they hold on the resolution any time to use them so despightfullie.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:207825:80"/> with irons, or kept close, like some noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious malefactor; or when his exchange is either utterly denyed him, or set at such rates, as seeme to necessitate a perpetuity of his endurance. These things (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse) do seldom happen to any man, that hath not given high occasion of offence by revolt, or treachery where he had been entrusted, unlesse there happen to be somewhat of a private spleene, or a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grudge. If a man have justly drawne such harshnesse upon himselfe, he must not wonder to finde from an enemie such usage as he hath deserved, when a freind would hardly put it up, to finde himselfe so abused: And it is not easie to finde what to plead for him that hath deceiv'd a trust, and been false to them from whom he hath receiv'd pay. If he will say their cause was naught, he should have lookt to that before he was engaged: for though he did well in quitting that side, where he thought he could not serve with a safe conscience (if that were really his motive) yet he suffers justly now for the assistanee that he gave them then, and it is just with God, to let him fall
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:207825:80"/> into this affliction, that was once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the author of as much affliction unto them, with whom afterwards (upon a rectified judgment) he thought fit to joyne: besides that he deserves to smart that would engage himselfe in a quarrell without mature deliberation, and not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his conscience, before he drew his sword; and he must not be his owne chooser when, or how he shall pay for such an oversight. If the cause were good, and he was false in it, he is clearly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable, and can have little comfort in his sufferings, though they be never so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, or long continued. But if all this befall him, by reason of some old grutch, or some new-taken displeasure, &amp; spight or malice lay it on so heavie, whilst he is conscious to himselfe of nothing, why his case should be disstinguished from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens, he may beare up the better, as being secure that such usage in the end shall bring both glorie, and renown to him, and shame, and infamie to those, whose unworthynesse did prompt them to such hatefull crueltie. And truly to ride out such a storme, I should thinke
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:207825:81"/> it no very hard matter to a man of spirit, and resolution. Irons and close impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and to want the hope of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, are a great affliction, yet such a one as is comportable. Many have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured them for many yeares together, and have found wayes to spend that time with comfort, and by little, and little, at last with some kind of contentment. And it is a great point of wisdome to fit the shoulder to the burden, and the neck. unto the yoake that we must neede beare. He is an ill proficient in the schoole of affliction, to whom it doth not grow familiar by tract of time, and whom dire necessitie doth not worke to some maste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his fortune, and enable by degrees to triumph in his patience, to triumph over the spight and malice of all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. If I should bate Christianitie, and yet exact this too, I should not be accompted a rigid Stoick in it. Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie could goe thus farre; let us blush if we be Christians, and come short of it.

Lesser hurts, which leave but scarrces behind them, and can be raised no higher then to be cal'd a blemish whether in the face it selfe, or in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, received in a good cause, they are to be accompted badges of honor, and memorialls of that danger which men did cheerfully undergoe, in discharge of their duty to their God, and to their
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:207825:82"/> Prince. And however fancie may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sway their opinions that want a solid judgment, yet reason tells us, that the most exact, and harmonious symetrie of an effeminate face, is not halfe so love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, as one markt with such scarres. For that fading beautie, which in the flower of youth is in the prime, and in a little time alters, and withers of it selfe, and by a fit of sicknesse, or a disease is so lost, that it never returnes againe, and which in men it is a vanitie at least, if not a sinne to be sollicitous, or studious to conserve, is here nobly exchanged, and devested with more honor then it could have been kept. He that perhaps before had more of the we aker, shall now have more of the wiser sex to be enamour'd of his mind, then they were with the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body: and there is lesse danger to have ten such lovers, then one of tother. But when a man happens to be so disabled▪ that he hath no hands to work, nor feete to walke, nor an eye to see, wherby he becomes in a high degree uselesse both to himselfe, and to his freinds, and runnes the hazard of wanting

How high doth man value life, when he buyes it on such hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions! and yet he may not part with it any cheaper although he would, but is obliged in point of conscience to suffer all this, and more, to save life, if it may possibly be preserved.

As it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres to them that inflict it, we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it unto severall causes. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hot blood occasions it, and long and violent resistance drawes it upon them that suffer it, sometimes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from malice, and is inflicted in the way of revenge, either upon some old grudge, or some new provocation, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there is a petulsnt wantonnesse in execution, and the conqueror doth heedlessely destroy, where he might safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spare. Sometimes there is an inhumane delight in cruelty, and a barbarous thirst of blood, even more then brutish. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times necessitie enforces that more be don in that kinde, then the conquerour would
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:207825:83"/> either desire, or permit, if he could ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the place, and persons without that rigour. This last case onely is excusable, the rest are not: and here likewise the pretence is easily made when other and worse motives put men on to doe it: besides that even in this case too, all lies in the conquerors bosom, and he hath a huge latitude wherein to act, and may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take up sooner, or lash out farther, and yet keepe under covert of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse. If this were a deliberate act, as it is alwayes a suddaine, it would aske a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere scrutinie, and the conscience could not easily be satisfied in this case, what bounds to set, or where to stoppe. As things are, I am confident, that in this case all men have need, and I should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise that all men would begge of God, to overrule them by his providence in the time of action; that they may not be more cruell then the necessitie of their owne safetie doth enforce; and that he would not lay that blood unto their charge which in such occasions they have shed, when they might have spar'd it. As death in this case referres to them
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:207825:84"/> that suffer it, we consider it as the thing that of all others▪ they have most fear'd, and shunn'd; fear'd not simplie as it is death, nor as it is a violent death, nor as it is a suddain death, for against all these we presume them fortified that enter a warre, or list themselves for souldiers: but as it is a weakning of the cause, as it is a discouragement of the partie, as it is an occasion for the enemies of God to blaspheme. And out of all these respects to feare it, doth neither misbecome a good man, nor a souldier. Besides that the justnesse of that feare makes it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in him, by all possible meanes to shunne, and to avoide it. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the care to avoide it, God pleases to let that fall upon them, which they so much, and so justlie feared. How unsearchable are his judgments, and his pathes past finding out! My undestanding may be gravel'd in these accidents, his justice cannot be tainted: I may be to seeke in the cause why he suffers these thinges to come to passe, but I am sure his wisdome and his goodnesse orders, and disposes all things for the best.

I am sure that to such a life, &amp; such a death there is a crowne reserved, which; if I have but patience and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to hold out unto the end, I shall not misse of.</p>
